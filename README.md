## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Theophile Cordiez ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI enthusiast and investment analyst passionate about new technologies. My journey into artificial intelligence began in 2019 during my engineering studies at Ã‰cole des Mines. At Cranfield University, I delved deeper into Natural Language Processing for document clusteringâ€”before tools like ChatGPT existed.

I've tackled real-world challenges such as optimizing logistics routes and helping predicting bankruptcies using machine learning at an insurtech startup Dimpl. Now, as part of the investment team at Passion Capital, I help scout tech startups.

When I'm not working, you'll find me soaring the skies. I've been flying for the past 10 years. You can check out one of my flights [here](https://www.weglide.org/flight/161017) 

#### Things I've worked on
- [Geospatial analysis of innovation clusters in a city based on document clustering methods](https://github.com/CordiezT/Master-Thesis)
- [Simulated annealing hybrid method for optimising time constrained delivery by a set of vehicles](https://github.com/CordiezT/projet2a)
- [How to predict a bankruptcy with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@theophilecordiez/why-and-how-to-create-a-bankruptcy-prediction-model-b559bbd50579)
- [Data Federation and Omics: A New Frontier in Drug Discovery](https://medium.com/@theophilecordiez/data-federation-and-omics-a-new-frontier-in-drug-discovery-68edcfcea98e)
- Computer-vision based system for detecting Covid-19 hazardous human interaction
- Proof of concept for the digitisation of airports via a smart contract solution for baggage logistics
- Customer feedback multi-shot classification with LLMs
- Theoretical physics: Ising model simulation via Monte-Carlo to showcase a phase transition of second order in ferromagnetic materials

If you think I deserve a little pick-me-up, why not treat me to a cup of coffee/tea?
