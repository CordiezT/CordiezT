## 👋 Hi there, I'm Theophile Cordiez 👋

My journey in the AI space started with a passion for mathematics. At Cranfield University, I researched Natural Language Processing before ChatGPT existed, I worked on various real-world problem such as improving truck logistics with algorithms, predicting bankruptcy with ML while working at an Insurtech startup. Now, at Passion Capital, I leverage my knowledge of AI to support and invest in tech startups. I'm also an avid glider pilot, always exploring new horizons -- check my flights [here](https://www.weglide.org/flight/161017) 


#### Things I've worked on
- [Geospatial analysis of innovation clusters in a city based on document clustering methods](https://github.com/CordiezT/Master-Thesis)
- [Simulated annealing hybrid method for optimising time constrained delivery by a set of vehicles](https://github.com/CordiezT/projet2a)
- [How to predict a bankruptcy with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@theophilecordiez/why-and-how-to-create-a-bankruptcy-prediction-model-b559bbd50579)
- [Data Federation and Omics: A New Frontier in Drug Discovery](https://medium.com/@theophilecordiez/data-federation-and-omics-a-new-frontier-in-drug-discovery-68edcfcea98e)
- Computer-vision based system for detecting Covid-19 hazardous human interaction
- Proof of concept for the digitisation of airports via a smart contract solution for baggage logistics
- Customer feedback multi-shot classification with LLMs
- Theoretical physics: Ising model simulation via Monte-Carlo to showcase a phase transition of second order in ferromagnetic materials

If you think I deserve a little pick-me-up, why not treat me to a cup of coffee/tea?
