## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Theophile Cordiez ðŸ‘‹

I scout tech startups at Passion Capital, where I lead sourcing efforts. My background includes developing machine learning models for predicting bankruptcy and customer churn at Dimpl, and creating an automated feedback analysis system while freelancing.

I hold a Master's in Applied Artificial Intelligence from Cranfield University and a Master's in Finance from ESSEC Business School.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid glider pilot with 250 flight hours and enjoy sailing. You can check out one of my flights here. [here](https://www.weglide.org/flight/161017) 

#### Things I've worked on
- [Geospatial analysis of innovation clusters in a city based on document clustering methods](https://github.com/CordiezT/Master-Thesis)
- [Simulated annealing hybrid method for optimising time constrained delivery by a set of vehicles](https://github.com/CordiezT/projet2a)

If you think I deserve a little pick-me-up, why not treat me to a cup of coffee/tea?
